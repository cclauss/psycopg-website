Psycopg 2.9 has been released!

.. role:: raw-html(raw)
   :format: html

This is a relatively small release compared to previous major releases.
However the creation of the packages took a lot of effort. The previously used
CI system now has reduced support for free software projects - it was decided
that package building should be moved to GitHub Actions.

Packaging has also become more complex because of the evolution of the Python
packaging standards and the need to support multiple architectures (Intel,
ARM, PPC...).

Maintaining a project such as Psycopg requires a lot of effort. For this
reason, we are extremely grateful to all our sponsors__ who are enabling the
maintenance and development of Psycopg. Thank you very much! :raw-html:`<i
